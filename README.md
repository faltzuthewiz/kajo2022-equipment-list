# kajo2022-equipment-list

This is the equipment list for the participants of the Finnish scout Jamboree (also known as "finnjamboree") Kajo 2022, published on the app Kajo Lux. 

There will be three language versions of the same list: Finnish, Swedish and English, since all three are the official languages of the camp.

The content of the equipment list itself was provided by some of the other volunteers of Kajo 2022. I added the instructions & created the technical side of the page.
